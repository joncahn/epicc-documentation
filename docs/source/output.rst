ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, and CUT&Tag
===============================

ChIP-seq (histone marks and transcription factors), CUT&RUN, and CUT&Tag all
share the ``ChIP/`` output directory. Assay types ``ChIP_broad``,
``ChIP_narrow``, ``CUT_RUN_broad``, ``CUT_RUN_narrow``, ``CUT_TAG_broad``, and
``CUT_TAG_narrow`` all route here.

Cluster and Differential Expression analysis
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Counts from ShortStack; analysis performed with EdgeR.

- ShortStack analysis on each replicate::

	results/sRNA/mapped/<Sample_ID>/       # ShortStack output folder with cluster results and alignment files
	results/sRNA/mapped/<Sample_ID>/clusters.bed  # simplified BED file of clusters for downstream analyses

- For all samples in the analysis, two runs will be performed by default (three with the optional TE analysis), which will create the same output
- The full ShortStack output will be located in these folders::
	
	results/clusters/<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_new_clusters/ # Identifying small RNA clusters, normalizing accross all samples
	results/clusters/<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_all_genes/ # Limiting mapping to all genes, normalizing accross all samples
	results/clusters/<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_all_TEs/ # Limiting mapping to all TEs, normalizing accross all samples (optional)

- Each folder (e.g. on new clusters) will also contain the files required for edgeR analysis and output from the differential analysis, following the same pattern than for DEG analysis of RNAseq::

	results/clusters/<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_new_clusters/counts_for_edgeR.txt # Count data for edgeR analysis
	results/clusters/<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_new_clusters/samples_for_edgeR.txt # Table of samples information for edgeR analysis

	results/clusters/<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_new_clusters/unique_DEGs.txt # list of clusters uniquely regulated in each sample

- For each differential analysis (e.g. on new clusters), similar output than for RNAseq DEGs will be generated, following the naming pattern ``sRNA_<analysis_name>_<ref_genome>__on_new_clusters`` pattern. It includes::
	
	results/sRNA/reports/summary_DEG_stats__<analysis_name>__<refgenome>__on_new_clusters.txt # number of differential regulated clusters in all pairwise comparisons and uniquely regulated in each sample
	results/combined/plots/BCV_RNAseq_<analysis_name>_<ref_genome>.pdf # Biological Coefficient of Variation of all genes
	results/combined/plots/MDS_RNAseq_<analysis_name>_<ref_genome>_<d12|d12_labs|d23|d23_labs>.pdf # Multidimensional scaling, all four versions
	results/combined/plots/Heatmap_sRNA_<cpm|zscore>__<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__on_new_clusters.pdf # expression values accross all differentially regulated clusters by count per million and zscore

   :align: center

   Upset plot of peaks in all histone and TF ChIP-seq samples


Heatmaps and metaplots
++++++++++++++++++++++

Performed with Deeptools.

- Heatmaps and metaplots will be performed on all genes in the reference genome, and on all TEs in the TE file provided if optional TE analysis is selected.
- Three sets of heatmaps and metaplots will be generated with a corresponding prefix, aligning all regions on their Transcription Start Sites (*tss*), Transcription End sites (*tes*) and scaling all regions to the same lenght (*regions*) (used for examples below).
- DNA methylation samples are treated separately for these outputs due to different interpolation method requirement for vizualization ('nearest' instead of 'bilinear' for the other data types).

- Deeptool matrices and sorted region files::

	results/combined/matrix/final_matrix_regions__most__<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__all_genes.gz # matrix scaled by regions for all samples except mC on all genes
	results/combined/matrix/final_matrix_regions__mC__<analysis_name>__<ref_genome>__all_genes.gz # matrix scaled by regions for mC samples on all genes
